# Adaboost
Implementation of the Adaboost algorithm. The goal is to have a library that allows for reading in labeled data from CSV files, training a model using that data, then saving a readout of that model. Preliminary testing of algorithm showed the ability to overfit on the ionosphere dataset at 99.1% accuracy. More nuanced validation involving train/test split for model validation is necessary in future work to further verify the algorithm.
